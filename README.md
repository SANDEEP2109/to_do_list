# to_do_list
This code implements a simple command-line To-Do List application in Python. The program allows the user to add tasks, display the list of tasks with their completion status, mark tasks as done, and exit the application. The tasks are stored in a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a task and its completion status.
