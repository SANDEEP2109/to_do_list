# to_do_list
This code implements a simple command-line To-Do List application in Python. The program allows the user to add tasks, display the list of tasks with their completion status, mark tasks as done, and exit the application. The tasks are stored in a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a task and its completion status.

Here's a brief description of its main functionalities:
1) Add Task: The user can input the number of tasks they want to add and then enter each task. Each task is stored with a status of "Not Done" initially.
2) Show Tasks: The user can view all tasks along with their statuses ("Done" or "Not Done").
3) Mark Task as Done: The user can mark a task as done by entering the task number, changing its status to "Done".
4) Exit: The user can exit the application.
